            <p class="govuk-heading-l">Check your details in the Rural Payments service</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">We may contact you by email or telephone, so it's important that we have up to date personal and business contact details for you. Check your details are correct in the Rural Payments service. If they are wrong, please update or register them as soon as possible. That way you can be sure we can contact you if we need to, for example if we need to talk to you about a payment. And you can make sure that we're able to accept any documents you email to us.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">It's also important that you check to make sure your permission levels for Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Countryside Stewardship (CS) are set and are correct.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">The information below shows each permission level and explains what a person with a particular level can do. If you need to change your level of permission, ask the person who has full permissions for the business to change it.</p>

            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">If you're an Environmental Stewardship (ES) customer you should have 'Make legal changes' or 'Full business' permissions. If you are registered as the agreement holder, or you are an agent with a valid authorisation form, we can accept or provide information on the agreement if you are listed against the business in the Rural Payments service.</p>

            <p class="govuk-heading-m">Have you changed your bank account details?</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">If you've changed your bank account since we last paid you (for example since BPS 2020, ES 2020 or CS 2020 payments) but have not told us, call us now on 03000 200 301 to update these. Make sure you do this by 5 November, so if you have a payment due in December, we can make it to the correct account.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body"><strong>If you used a banking switch service when you changed your bank account they will have told us that your account has changed, so you do not need to contact us.</strong></p>

            <p class="govuk-body">You can ask us to make changes to your bank account details between 8 November- 30 November but we may have already processed your payment using the old details. We will only make changes to bank account details in December in very limited circumstances, for example if we ask you for them.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Remember, you must have 'Business details: Full or Make legal changes' permission level in the Rural Payments service before you can ask us to update your bank account details.</p>
