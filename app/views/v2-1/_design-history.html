      Background
    </h2>
    <p>
      The previous prototype focused on adding new actions to an existing agreement (version 2).
      It was decided, following a the 2nd round of User Research with farmers, that we were confident in this area for the alpha phase.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
      One part of the journey we hadn't deeply explored was how to show an updated agreement so a user can decide whether to accept or reject it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this scenario:
    </p>
    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
      <li>a user has applied to add new actions to an existing agreement</li>
      <li>the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) has accepted the updates and contracted the user to either accept or reject the update</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We put together
      <a href="https://app.mural.co/t/coredefra2548/m/coredefra2548/1741768273950/c58a2e35067a20b16a7a2b905b4e622b0cead542?wid=0-1753181313894" target="_blank">
      a (very) basic screen flow (opens in a new tab)</a>, so we were all on the same page.
    </p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Design approach
    </h2>
    <p>
      The problem to consider was how to show the user the updated version of the agreement with both the existing actions as well
      as the new actions, and any resulting changes in payment, annual declaration and other legal information.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then did some exploration; considering the things we may want to learn from research, looking for other services that
      have done a similar thing, as well as looking for patterns and ways the information could be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came up with some ‘how might we’ and ‘we could…’ statements to help us ideate a solution.
    </p>

      The ideation work was carried out on the
      <a href="https://app.mural.co/t/coredefra2548/m/coredefra2548/1741768273950/c58a2e35067a20b16a7a2b905b4e622b0cead542?wid=0-1747296254390" target="_blank">

    </p>
    <p>
      We played around with some ‘we could...’ statements generated from the HWM’s to create some ideas around how to show the agreement to the user.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px">
      To start, the statement ‘We could provide a filterable table so a user can choose to view by start date, expiry date, action name, code, etc.’ was used.
    </p>
    <img src="/public/images/design-history-v2_1/table.png" alt="Screen design showing a table of all actions for an agreement." class="design-history">
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px">
      It was thought that this was a lot of information and not that easy to differentiate the newly added actions, so another mock-up was made that still used
      the table idea but separated the new actions into their own area.
    </p>
    <img src="/public/images/design-history-v2_1/table-separate-new.png" alt="Screen design showing a separated area at the top containing a table of all new actions
     for an agreement, and a table underneath containing previous actions on the agreement." class="design-history">
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px">
      Another statement we had was ‘we could arrange by groups of actions’. As there was common data across all rows in the table, to try and minimise the
      duplication of information some mock-ups were created grouping each set of actions.
    </p>
    <img src="/public/images/design-history-v2_1/cards.png" alt="Screen design showing actions separated onto different cards depending on when the action was added."

         style="margin-left:20px; width:48%" class="design-history">
    <p>
      To get the most out of the research it was decided to strip out as much information as possible, whilst still leaving the necessary data to understand what
      was in the agreement, to learn what the users actually needed to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      We finalised which ‘we could...’ statements to use and agreed on the final design of the agreements page. The content and designs for the email that is sent
      to the user to trigger them to check and accept the agreement was created; as were the pages outlining the legal information and the confirmation screen
      letting the user know what will happen next.

      It wasn't immediately clear for users that other actions already in the same agreement were below the grey box with updated actions.

      Conclusions and next steps
    </h2>
    <p>
      We learnt that the whole journey needs to be included in a research session as the participants did not fully understand what the actions
      were, and why they had been included, which contributed to the concept of a single agreement not being followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of the content will need some iteration and the page that is showing the updated agreement, or the offer that the user needs
      to accept, needs to be reconsidered. Some of the other designs from the ideation session could be iterated upon using the findings
      from this round of research, including more details regarding the land being entered into an action.
