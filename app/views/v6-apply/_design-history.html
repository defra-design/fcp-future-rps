    <p>During the last round of research, as detailed in the <a href="/v5-apply/_design-history">previous Design History</a>, several elements of the mapping design were observed to need usability improvements, and so have been addressed as follows.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Usability issues and fixes</h3>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Farm selection</h4>

    <p class="govuk-body">Selecting a farm did not remove the non-selected farm's name and details from view, which caused confusion. This has been corrected so that only the selected farm's information were displayed.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Also, guidance copy has been added to help the user understand how to use the map and desired actions in conjunction with each other.</p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Parcel names and IDs</h4>

    <p class="govuk-body">Parcel IDs were not previously included. Thus could casuse issues for farmers if multiple parcels shared the same name, which was evidenced by some participants in research.
     Parcel IDs were therefore added to the parcel text links alongside parcel names to address this.</p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Parcel list below the map</h4>

    <p class="govuk-body">The "show more parcels" link (conditional reveal) displayed a numeric value (e.g. "5 more"), which users found confusing. 
      This has been removed so the link simply indicates that additional parcels are available.</p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Visibility of actions from previous agreements</h4>

    <p class="govuk-body">Users had difficulty locating actions from previous agreements, particularly when interacting with parcels on the map, resulting in excessive scrolling. 
      This was because some users didn't notiice the tabualr data below the map when their gaze was focused on the parcel within the map itself.
      <p>This was addressed by adding information about existing actions to the clickable popups for a parcel on the map.
      Space is limited within the popup, and increasing it's size hides neighbouring parcels, so only a summary of existing actions is provided there.
      A jump-link takes the user to the full details of the existing actions for that parcel (within the appropriate accordion section towards the foot of the page).
    </p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Actions just added or from existing agreements</h4>

    <p class="govuk-body">Users were unclear about the distinction between parcels with actions from previous agreements and parcels updated in the current session. 
      This was fixed by increasing the size of the section headings, while decreasing the size of the parcels names within the sections.<br>
      This improved the visual hierarchy of the component, making section headings stand out in comparision to the content within them.</p>
      <p>A bespoke component heading (above the first section of the accordion), which isn't usually included in the standard accordion component, was also removed as it didn't appear to improve findability or understanding of the component for farmers.
        It may have also merely served to distract the user from the content section headings below it.</p>
