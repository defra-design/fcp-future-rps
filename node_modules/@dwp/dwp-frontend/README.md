# DWP Frontend

DWP Frontend contains the UI elements consumed by the [DWP design system](https://design-system.dwp.gov.uk)

It is maintained by the DWP Design System Team.

The team welcomes [contributions](https://github.com/dwp/design-system/issues).

## Version History

Check the project [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Getting Started

You can install `dwp-frontend` using either the GitLab or NPM registry.

Once you've installed the package you will need to configure it.

Recent versions of the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit) add dwp-frontend as a plugin - so you can use the components/HTML without config.

If you are not using the prototype kit you will need to [configure the SASS](https://github.com/dwp/design-system/blob/main/app/assets/sass/application.scss#L25) and [your view engine](https://github.com/dwp/design-system/blob/main/server.js#L33) to have context of the components.

### NPM:

1. Install the dwp-frontend package:

`npm i @dwp/dwp-frontend`.

## Testing

Unit tests are included in each folder of the component
