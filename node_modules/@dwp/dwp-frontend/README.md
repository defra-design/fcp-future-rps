## Version History

Check the project [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Getting Started

You can install `dwp-frontend` using either the GitLab or NPM registry.

Once you've installed the package you will need to configure it.

Recent versions of the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit) allow you to install DWP frontend [as a plugin](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/install-and-use-plugins) - so you can use the components/style without config.

If you are not using the prototype kit you will need to [configure the SASS](https://github.com/dwp/design-system/blob/main/app/assets/sass/application.scss#L25) and [your view engine](https://github.com/dwp/design-system/blob/main/server.js#L33) to have context of the components.

### NPM:

1. Install the dwp-frontend package:

`npm i @dwp/dwp-frontend`.
